# Rousseau Gambit

The Rousseau Gambit (or Ponziani Countergambit after Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 f5The gambit is named after French chess master Eug√®ne Rousseau. White can decline the gambit by supporting the e-pawn with 4.d3. The resulting position is similar to a King's Gambit Declined with colours reversed, and White's king bishop aiming at Black's weakened kingside. Black will have trouble castling kingside, and Ng5 is a likely threat. White's position is better, but still requires careful play.
Key themes for White are to attack Black's kingside and to avoid attempts by Black to simplify the position. Exchanges involving White's light-square bishop are particularly suspect.
